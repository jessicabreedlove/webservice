Movie App Backend - Node.js

Building front and backend in 4 hours is no joke!

I began with the backend. I connected my app to heroku and got a url from TMDB API, but ran into some issues getting it to run. Ideally I would have been getting the data, so I could then use the data in my frontend.

Even though the backend wasn't functioning as it should, I started on the frontend (so I would have something to show). I wanted to use good design principles and have a small, medium, large view with media queries, but I ran out of time. I also wanted to bring in my data dynamically, but that ended up being futile since the backend wasn't functioning yet. My vue also isn't working. But I tried to impliment it anyways.
